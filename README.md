This repo is a portfolio of front-end development! It's currently under development, and will be worked on in the coming months! :)

The goal is to have a presentable portfolio website, with a solida grasp of:
- Markup (HTML, CSS)
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Then, the React library

- All while learning to use Git, the Github site, and more!
