                    <p>Hi! My name's William Macluskie!
                        I'm a technology graduate and this is my test website! It looks terrible, currently, but it'll get better with time! :)

                    <p>As of May 2024, I've started working on the skeletal HTML markup for the site! 
                        It's barebones, but will come along in time.
                
                    <p> My current task: I'm reviewing CSS basics, so I can start to make this
                        website look nicer, and get a better feel for structuring pages.
                        I'll also be looking at accessibility guidance and making sure there
                        are alt tags setup for non-atext elements.
                        
                        I'm also working on very basic CSS markup! A lot of this is "in progress", practice work, so
                        expect the site to look pretty...basic, for a while, until I start integrating some more markup, features
                        and maybe some design in too! ^^
                    </p>

                    <li>I'm currently working on CSS colours and making a good colour scheme.</li>
                    <li>I'm also poking some basic CSS attributes to change some page structuring 
                        and other border elements so the page looks better! Nearly finished with some
                        basic CSS modelling on Freecodecamp!
