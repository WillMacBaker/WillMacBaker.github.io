                    <p>Hi! My name's William Macluskie!
                        I'm a technology graduate and this is my test website! It looks terrible, currently, but it'll get better with time! :)

                    <p>As of Jan 2025, I've been working solely on my JS skills, and hopefully will shuffle this onto something React-based,
                        so that it looks professional...soon.
                    <p>

                    <li><b>Freecodecamp Javascript Portfolio Submissions</b></li>
                    <li>First solo-coded (with a lot of google-fu) exercise; a palindrome checker that
                        sanitises user-input using regex to only A-Za-z characters, and check if the text supplied
                        is the same forwards, as it is backwards. <a href="/JSPortfolio/palindromeCheck/palindrome.html">You can check it out by clicking this text.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second portfolio exercise: This exercise was to create a arabic -> roman numeral number converter project.
                        You can <a href = "/JSPortfolio/romanNumeralConverter/roman.html">check out the Roman Numeral converter here!</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Third portfolio exercise: This exercise is designed to test my regex understanding, and algorithmic thinking in terms of 
                        putting more moving parts together. It checks for a valid US phone number and updates/checks any that are added. Want to check
                        it out? <a href="/JSPortfolio/telephoneValidator/phoneValidator.html">Click here to check out the phone number validator!</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fifth and final JS portfolio exercise (I shall do the fourth one in time, shhh): This one is designed to test my usage and understanding of making requests to 
                        an external API, and parse returned data into a format that can then be process on a page! This particular one uses
                        the Pokemon API, and <a href = "/JSPortfolio/pokemonSearch/pokemon.html">lets you search pokemon by their ID or name</a>
                    </li>
