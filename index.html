                <p>Hi! My name's William Macluskie!
                    I'm a technology graduate and this is my test website! It looks terrible, currently, but it'll get better with time! :)
                </p>

                <p>As of May 2024, I've started working on the skeletal HTML markup for the site! 
                    It's barebones, but will come along in time.
                </p>

                <p>My current task: I'm reviewing CSS basics, so I can start to make this
                    website look nicer, and get a better feel for structuring pages.
                    I'll also be looking at accessibility guidance and making sure there
                    are alt 
                </p>
